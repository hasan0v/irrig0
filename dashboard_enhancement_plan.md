# Dashboard Enhancement Plan

**Project Goal:** Enhance the dashboard's data visualization and UI to provide a more informative and user-friendly experience.

**Plan:**

1.  **Analyze Existing Dashboard Implementation:**
    *   Examine the `app/templates/dashboard.html` file to understand the current structure and layout of the dashboard.
    *   Review the `app/static/css/style.css` and `app/static/css/material.css` files to identify the existing styling and CSS frameworks used.
    *   Analyze the JavaScript code in `app/static/js/script.js` to understand how the dashboard data is fetched and updated.
    *   Identify the specific data points that are currently displayed on the dashboard and how they are visualized.

2.  **Identify Potential Data Visualizations:**
    *   Based on the available sensor data in the `SensorData` model, identify opportunities to add more data visualizations to the dashboard.
    *   Consider using different chart types (e.g., line charts, bar charts, pie charts, gauges) to represent the data in a more visually appealing and informative way.
    *   Explore the use of libraries like Chart.js or Plotly to create interactive and customizable charts.
    *   Refer to the `prd.md` file for guidance on which data points are most important to display and how they should be visualized.

3.  **Design UI Enhancements:**
    *   Improve the overall layout and design of the dashboard to make it more user-friendly and visually appealing.
    *   Consider using a grid-based layout to organize the data visualizations and other UI elements.
    *   Add tooltips or hover effects to provide more information about the data points.
    *   Implement a responsive design to ensure that the dashboard looks good on different screen sizes.
    *   Consider using a UI framework like Bootstrap or Materialize to streamline the UI development process.

4.  **Implement Data Visualizations and UI Enhancements:**
    *   Modify the `app/templates/dashboard.html` file to add the new data visualizations and UI elements.
    *   Update the `app/static/css/style.css` and `app/static/css/material.css` files to style the new elements and improve the overall look and feel of the dashboard.
    *   Modify the JavaScript code in `app/static/js/script.js` to fetch the necessary data and update the visualizations accordingly.

5.  **Test and Refine:**
    *   Thoroughly test the updated dashboard to ensure that the data visualizations are accurate and the UI is user-friendly.
    *   Gather feedback from users and make adjustments to the design and implementation as needed.
